Non-beliefism
==================

Beyond atheism, non-beliefism (coined by God Bennett in 2015) enables a state of mind that rejects not merely religious belief, but the very concept of belief.   

Thus, this paradigm persists such that belief is scrutinized/purged. (be it atheistic or theistic)  

The reasonably optimal goal is to contribute to critical thinking/atheistic/scientific methologogies for contributing to artificial general intelligence, often refered to as mankind's last invention.
